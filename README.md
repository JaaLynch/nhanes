# NHANES

[Continuous NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx)

Needs:
* Easy way to download all the continuous NHANES data.  Build a list of links to all possible tables.
* Easy way to understand what the fields mean (good documentation exhists, just an app to link to it)
* Easy way to sift through, look at the head and distributions thereof
* Could the first few steps above be served by an NHANES data exploration app?

* Join it all together
* Attach the mortality feedback
* Do some analytics on it through an app?

Thinking through how to do the first few bullets
Select your year, select your tables, download those tables if they dont exist
Link to the documentation for that table
Produce basic visualization of the table
